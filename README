This is the serverside code for TasteBuddy, our iPhone app.  I did not code this - I managed a team of developers who made TasteBuddy.  I have since learned Ruby on Rails to manage developers better as well as to develop myself.

About TasteBuddy:

You don’t eat restaurants, you eat dishes. Sure, there are ample ways to look up a restaurant and even find out what it serves, but to know what to eat without having tried everything before you are going to need something different: an amigo with an extensible palate who has tasted widely and knows the right dishes for each occasion, wherever you are.

Let us introduce TasteBuddy: TasteBuddy is a new App for the iPhone (and soon other platforms as well). TasteBuddy brings you the scoop about dishes you have never eaten before as well as the ability to discover dishes you will love, wherever you are.

It is with great pleasure that our team announces to you the release of TasteBuddy, our obsession for the last few months.
